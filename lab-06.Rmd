### Packages and Data

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r diamon_rename}
diamonds <- diamonds %>% rename(
    depth_pct = depth,
    length_mm = x,
    width_mm = y,
    depth_mm = z,
    table_pct = table
  )
```


## Exercise 1
```{r}


diamonds_filter <- diamonds%>%
  filter(length_mm > 0,
         width_mm > 0,
         depth_mm > 0)

print(diamonds_filter)

diamonds_filter%>%
  summarise(
    mean_carat = mean(carat),
    mean_price = mean(price),
    mean_length = mean(length_mm),
    mean_width = mean(width_mm),
    mean_depth = mean(depth_mm)
  )

diamonds_filter%>%
  count(cut)

diamonds_filter%>%
  count(color)

```


## Exercise 2

```{r}

diamonds <- diamonds %>%
  mutate(table_mm = table_pct * width_mm / 100)

# Overall table_mm arithmetic mean?






# table_mm arithmetic mean within each clarity category






```

## Exercise 3

_Do derivation on paper, unless you know how to write LaTeX code_


## Exercise 4

```{r}
# Write gmean() command



```

## Exercise 5

```{r, error = TRUE}

test_data <- list(
  test1 = c(2.1, 3.8, 4.2),
  test2 = c(1, 10, 100, 1000),
  test3 = c(0, 1, 4),
  test4 = c(0.38,  0.94, -1.56),
  test5 = c(TRUE, TRUE),
  test6 = c("6", "7", "8")
)


# Create for loop to test gmean() on the above examples


```


## Exercise 6

```{r}
# Copy gmean() from Ex4 and edit it to check the input





# Copy your code from Ex 5 to test your new command





```


## Exercise 7

```{r}
# Overall table_mm geometic mean?






# table_mm geometic mean within each clarity category






```

## Exercise 8 (optional)

```{r}
# Create gmean2() that computes the geometric mean 
#   that uses the original definition






```


## Exercise 9 (optional)

```{r}
# Create a function that computes the harmonic mean







```
